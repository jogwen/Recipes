Mo's Beetroot Cake
(A Tiny Bit Marvellous, a novel by Dawn French)

180g caster sugar
3 medium eggs
180g plain flour
180g ground almonds
50g cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
pinch of salt
200ml sour cream
1 tsp vanilla extract
200g raw, peeled and finely grated beetroot

Icing
170g icing sugar, sifted
2 tbsp water
1/4 tspn cream of tartar
1 medium egg white
1/2 tspn vanilla extract
drop of pink food colouring (optional)

Handful of hazelnuts to decorate, chopped

1. Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease a 20cm tin with vegetable oil and line the base with baking parchment.
2. Whisk together the eggs and sugar for 5 minutes with electric beaters, until light and fluffy. Add the flour, almonds, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Beat to combine.
3. Beat in the sour cream and vanilla essence. Squeeze out any excess liquid from the grated beetroot and fold into the mixture.
4. Pour the mixture into the tin and bake for 50 minutes. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
5. Meanwhile, make the icing. Place all the ingredients into a bowl and place the bowl on top of a pan of simmering water until the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and place on a heatproof surface and with the bowl still standing over the pan, whisk on a high speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks.
6. Cover the top of the cake with the icing and scatter over the chopped hazelnuts.
7. Take swig of home-made sloe gin. For cook.
