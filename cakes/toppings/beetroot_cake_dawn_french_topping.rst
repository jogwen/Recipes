Icing for Mo's Beetroot Cake
(A Tiny Bit Marvellous, a novel by Dawn French)

170g icing sugar, sifted
2 tbsp water
1/4 tspn cream of tartar
1 medium egg white
1/2 tspn vanilla extract
drop of pink food colouring (optional)

Handful of hazelnuts to decorate, chopped

5. Meanwhile, make the icing. Place all the ingredients into a bowl and place the bowl on top of a pan of simmering water until the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and place on a heatproof surface and with the bowl still standing over the pan, whisk on a high speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks.
6. Cover the top of the cake with the icing and scatter over the chopped hazelnuts.
7. Take swig of home-made sloe gin. For cook.
