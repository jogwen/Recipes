Gingerbread [vegan]
===================

- 180C / 350F / gas 4
- makes enough biscuits to fill two oven shelves
- notes for vegan gingerbread in square brackets below

These are really tasty cookies, and if you get the baking time right will be
solid but deliciously soft in the middle.

Ingredients
-----------
- 350g plain flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda [1.5 for vegan]
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 175g soft brown sugar
- 125g block margarine (cold from fridge)
- 1 egg [none for vegan]
- 5 tbsp golden syrup [6 for vegan]
- tap water if necessary
- some more flour for dredging
- some more fat for greasing (unless using silicone baking trays)

Equipment
---------
- some combination of baking trays to fill two shelves of a standard oven
- sieve
- large bowl
- knife for mixing (ideally round ended and non serrated)
- rolling pin
- more flour for dredging
- cookie cutters (or a knife to cut into squares/rectangles)
- clean hands!

Steps
-----
- Sift flour, bicarbe, ginger and cinnamon into the bowl, add the sugar and mix well
- Add the butter/margarine cut into cubes (about 1cm cubed) and then use the knife
  to stir them in to cover in flour, cut through the cubes, stir them in, cut
  again and so on until the lumps of fat are quite small.
- Now flour your fingers and use them to squish the remaining lumps flat, stir
  them in and then finally rub all the remaining bits of fat into the flour
  mixture until the whole thing resembles fine breadcrumbs.
- Stir in the egg and then the syrup until the mixture starts to resemble dough.
  Use your hand to sprinkle on some tap water if necessary.
- Flour your fingers and an area of worktop, and then use your hands to collect
  all the dough together into a ball, and knead it briefly on the worktop until it seems
  uniform and smooth and stays in a ball. If it's overly sticky at this stage,
  keep dredging some flour over it and your hands and then kneading it in until
  you're happier with the consistency.
- Put the ball back in your bowl, cover and place in the fridge for 15 minutes
- Use this time to preheat the oven to 180C / 350F / Gas 4 and grease the base of your baking trays (if you're using silicone baking trays you can skip this) 
- After 15 minutes, ensure you still have a light covering of flour on your
  worktop, lightly dredge your rolling pin in flour and roll out the dough to
  about 0.5cm thick, then cut into shapes and place in the trays taking care to
  leave at least 1cm gap in between them (the cookies expand during cooking and
  will all stick together if you're not careful). Re-roll and cut cookies until
  you run out of dough. I just squish the last little bit flat and bake that one
  as it is as the cook's perks ;D
- Bake for 10-14 minutes until golden brown, swapping the top and bottom shelf
  trays around half way for a more even bake.
- Leave for 10 minutes to solidify slightly before lifting out to finish cooling
  on a rack
- Wait until completely cook before decorating
