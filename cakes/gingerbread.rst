Gingerbread
===========

- 180C / 350F / gas 4
- makes enough biscuits to fill two oven shelves

These are really tasty cookies, and if you get the baking time right will be
solid but deliciously soft in the middle.

Ingredients
-----------
- 350g plain flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 175g soft brown sugar
- 125g butter or block margarine (cold from fridge)
- 1 egg
- 5 tbsp golden syrup

Equipment
---------
- some combination of baking trays to fill two shelves of a standard oven
- sieve
- large bowl
- knife for mixing (ideally round ended and non serrated)
- rolling pin
- more flour for dredging
- cookie cutters (or a knife to cut into squares/rectangles)
- clean hands!

Steps
-----
- Sift flour, bicarbe, ginger and cinnamon into the bowl, add the sugar and mix well
- Add the butter/margarine cut into cubes (about 1cm cubed) and then use the knife
  to stir them in to cover in flour, cut through the cubes, stir them in, cut
  again and so on until the lumps of fat are quite small.
- Now flour your fingers and use them to squish the remaining lumps flat, stir
  them in and then finally rub all the remaining bits of fat into the flour
  mixture until the whole thing resembles fine breadcrumbs.
- Stir in the egg and then the syrup until the mixture starts to resemble dough
- Flour your fingers and an area of worktop, and then use your hands to collect
  all the dough together into a ball, and knead it briefly on the worktop until it seems
  uniform and smooth and stays in a ball.
- Put the ball back in your bowl, cover and place in the fridge for 15 minutes
- Use this time to preheat the oven to 180C / 350F / Gas 4 and (if you're not using silicone baking trays) make sure their bases are well greased.
- After 15 minutes, ensure you still have a light covering of flour on your
  worktop, lightly dredge your rolling pin in flour and roll out the dough to
  about 0.5cm thick, then cut into shapes and place in the trays taking care to
  leave at least 1cm gap in between them (the cookies expand during cooking and
  will all stick together if you're not careful)
- Bake for 10-14 minutes until golden brown, swapping the top and bottom shelf
  trays around half way for a more even bake.
- Leave for 10 minutes to solidify slightly before lifting out to finish cooling
  on a rack
- Wait until completely cook before decorating
