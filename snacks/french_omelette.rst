Serves: 1

Ingredients

 - 3 eggs
 - 1 tablespoon chopped chives
 - 1 teaspoon chopped parsley
 - Â½teaspoon chooped tarragon
 - salt and pepper
 - a knob of butter

Steps
-----

 #. Whisk together the eggs, herbs, salt and pepper.
 #. Melt the butter in a 20cm frying pan. Once it foams, pour in the egg
    mixture. Reduce the heat a little and let the omelette begin to set around
    the sides, turning the pan so that it cooks evenly.
 #. As the edges begin to set use a fork or spatula to lift up the sides here
    and there around the permiter of the omelette, nudging them towards the
    centre and allowing runny egg to slide down into the gap. Continue cooking
    in this way until the omelette is almost set, but still moist on top.
    It will carry on cooking in its own heat after it leafes the pan, so don't
    overcook it.
 #. Flip one side over on to the centre of the omelette, then tilt the pan
    towards the awaiting plate, and flip the omelette gently out on to it, so
    that folds nearlt in three. Eat straighaway.
